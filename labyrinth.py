"""
This module defines the Labyrinth class which is used to create, draw, and update a labyrinth. The labyrinth is
represented as a grid of tiles, each of which can have borders on each of its sides. The labyrinth is drawn on a
Tkinter Canvas, and it can be updated in real time based on the information in a JSON file or a Queue.

The Labyrinth class includes methods for creating the labyrinth, drawing it on the canvas, updating the labyrinth
based on the JSON file or the Queue, and handling the turtle's visualization and orientation.

The Queue is used to store the graph structure of the labyrinth. It is checked before the JSON file for updates.
If there's an update in the Queue, it is used to update the labyrinth. If the Queue is empty, the JSON file is checked
for updates.

This module is part of a labyrinth project.
